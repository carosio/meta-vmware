I. Building the meta-vmware SP layer
=======================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to clone the tplino-core repository. 

Having done that, and assuming you placed the folder 
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a
vmware image by adding the location of the tplino-meta-vmware
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  yocto/meta-xxxx \
yocto/meta-xxxx/tplino-meta-vmware \

To enable the vmware layer, add the vmware MACHINE to local.conf:

MACHINE ?= "vmware"

You should then be able to build a vmware image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-tplino

At the end of a successful build, you should have an 
virtual machine disk(vmdk) you can boot that as 
hard disk from an virtual maschine.
